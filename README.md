## Getting started

Follow these steps to get started developing your own react component:

- `git clone https://github.com/DZuz14/dz-slider.git`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` to transpile both the lib and docs folder in watch mode and serve the docs page for you.
- Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 (If your browser doesnt automatically open for you) to see the demo in action. Whenever you change the code in either src/lib or src/docs, the page will automatically update.

## Pull Requests
- Fork the repo and create a new branch with name of your choosing.
- `npm run build` before you submit the PR.
