## Getting started

Follow these steps to get started developing your own react component:

- Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 (_If your browser doesnt automatically open for you_)

## Contributing

- Fork the repo and create a new branch with name of your choosing
- Source for the module itself will be in `src/lib`
- To make changes to the demo page, use the files in `src/docs`
- Please note that the slider has some default styling in the index.html of `src/docs`. You can change it there.
